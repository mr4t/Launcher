# Launcher
## Access your files from one place

# What is this?
I made this app for use my files easily. If you add your app one time then you dont have to remember where you saved it so you can make your desktop tidy. You can search your file with saved name on the app or you can just click to app icon you gave before (if you dont want give icon i will show that with no icon icon .d)

## How to use?
  - Append your apps from settings menu
    - Set random name (you dont use before on launcher)
    - Give file path (this must be true for launcher can open your file properly)
    - Just like i said before if you give me the photo i will show your file with that if you dont it will be not found icon
    - If your app or icon gets corrupted or deleted laucher will show you no icon for icon and will cant start app when you try for app
  - Change launcher background from background menu
    - Set photo or color to your launcher and prewiev it after that just save it (if you want to use photo i think use simple something so you can read names easily from launcher)
    - If you set photo and if this photo gets corrupted or deleted laucher will start with default settings
  - Open file you saved before
    - Just click to icon from laucher or search from top and press enter
